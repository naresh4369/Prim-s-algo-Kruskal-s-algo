# Prim-s-algo-Kruskal-s-algo


Prim's algo:

This falls under greedy algo class. 

The steps for implementing Prim's algorithm are as follows:
1) Initialize the minimum spanning tree with a vertex chosen at random.
2) Find all the edges that connect the tree to new vertices, find the minimum and add it to the tree
3) Keep repeating step 2 until we get a minimum spanning tree

Kruskal's Algo:

Steps:

1) Sort all the edges from low weight to high
2) Take the edge with the lowest weight and add it to the spanning tree. If adding the edge created a cycle, then reject this edge.
3) Keep adding edges until we reach all vertices.


Installation is straight forward. Two separate files used for Prim's and Kruskal's Algo. We just need to execute those files separately.
